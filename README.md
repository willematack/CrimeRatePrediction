## Crime Rate Analysis and Prediction

Purpose: This was my term project for Methods of Applied Statistics (Fall 2023). Using a complex dataset containing environmental and demographic data of 2,000+ communities in the United States, and their associated rates of different crimes, the research question was two-fold:

- What are the most significant predictors of crime, and do these depend on crime type?
- How can we build a predictive model to predict crime rates for different crime types in new communities. In particular, I compared the performance of traditional linear regression techniques to modern tree-based models.

- My final report can be found [here](https://github.com/willematack/CrimeRatePrediction/blob/main/Deliverables/STA2101_Final_Report.pdf). It provides a detailed description of ethods used, and their justification, as well as a summary of results.
